# KinetiX-Downloader

A python script for downloading the Kinetics 400, 600, and 700 datasets.

[Kinetics](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics) is a large-scale, high-quality dataset of URL links to approximately 650,000 video clips that covers 700 human action classes, including  human-object interactions such as playing instruments, as well as  human-human interactions such as shaking hands and hugging. Each action class has at least 600 video clips. Each clip is human annotated with a single action class and lasts around 10s.
